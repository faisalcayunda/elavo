    <div class="about">
      <p>"Elavo" means "to clean" in Latin. We are confident that our products can help people clean things as well as their hands or other body parts. Our products are made from used cooking oil which is processed into soap. Of course it's better than throwing it away carelessly.<br><br>
  
  This soap can be an effective cleanser, and with the olive oil and coconut oil content in it, this soap can be a natural skin moisturizer. This soap is also a source of healthy fatty acids and can reduce inflammation of the skin.</p>
